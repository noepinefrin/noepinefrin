# Welcome to @noepinefrin's GitHub Repository!
Hi there! I'm @noepinefrin, a passionate data scientist and bioinformatician intern at Marmara University Systems Bioengineering Research group. I'm thrilled to share my work with you here on GitHub, where I showcase my expertise in cancer data analysis and computer vision. I am working with Prof. Dr Kazım Yalçın ARĞA which is Professor of bioengineering and senior expert on bioinformatics and multi-omics research, head of Marmara University’s Systems Bioengineering Research Group.

## Who am I?
I'm a data enthusiast with a keen interest in bioinformatics and systems biology. My experience in working with TCGA cancer data, particularly gene expression data, has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the complexities of cancer biology and the potential of data-driven approaches in improving cancer diagnosis and treatment.

## What do I do?
As a data scientist and bioinformatician, I am constantly exploring and analyzing cancer data to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of cancer and identify potential biomarkers. I use various statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze large-scale datasets, extract meaningful information, and generate actionable insights.

In addition to my expertise in cancer data analysis, I'm also currently diving into the fascinating field of computer vision. I'm passionate about leveraging computer vision techniques to extract valuable information from visual data, and I'm excited to explore the potential applications of computer vision in healthcare and biomedicine.

## What can you expect from my GitHub?
On my GitHub repository, you'll find a collection of my data analysis and computer vision projects, along with the code and documentation associated with them. I'm committed to creating well-organized and well-documented code, so you can easily understand and reproduce my work. I also strive to follow best practices in data science, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## How can we collaborate?
I'm always eager to collaborate with fellow data scientists, bioinformaticians, and researchers who share my passion for using data to drive insights and create meaningful impact in healthcare and biomedicine. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or have any questions about my work, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm open to discussions, feedback, and suggestions, and I'm always looking to learn and grow in my field.
